Artifacts and Code Distribution for web publications.
These are several experimental projects that I did for various machine learning and deep learning applications.


### Computer Vision
- [Dogs vs Cats Image Classification](keras-image-classification-dogs-cats/keras-image-classification-dogs-cats.ipynb) (Keras): Given an image of a dog or cat, determine which animal is it using Keras Framework and CNN Architecture

### NLP

### Audio

### GAN

### Classification
- [Iris Classification](keras-classification-iris/NeuralNetwork_Iris_Classification.ipynb) (Keras): Using Toy Iris Dataset, classify which Iris flower based on the width and length of stem and petals by using an Artificial Neural Network.
  
### Regression
- [Possum Age Regression](keras-regression-possum) (Keras): Using possum measurements, predict the age of a possum using Keras Deep Learning framework.

### Cloud
## Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- [AWS Kinesis Anomaly Detection](kinesis-anomaly-detection) (Kinesis): Create a Kinesis Data Stream to receive events from an emitter. Report anomalies based on SQL query and AWS Random Cut Forest Algorithm.
