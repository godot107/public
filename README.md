These are several experimental projects that I did for various machine learning and deep learning applications.


### Computer Vision
- [Dogs vs Cats Image Classification](keras-image-classification-dogs-cats/keras-image-classification-dogs-cats.ipynb) (Keras): Given an image of a dog or cat, determine which animal is it using Keras Framework and CNN Architecture

### NLP

### Audio

### GAN

### Classification
- [Dogs vs Cats Image Classification](keras-classification-iris/NeuralNetwork_Iris_Classification.ipynb) (Keras): Using Toy Iris Dataset, classify which Iris flower based on width and length of stem and petals by using an Artificial Neural Network.
### Regression
